## What is VST2SQL?
A simple tool to commit data from a visio vst file to an sqlite database.
### Making-Of
VST2SQL was made as part of an internship in a data management company, and it allows a user to export specific ShapeData and other sections of a visio file's shapes into a database, in order to use it another applications and vst files easily.

The library "MyVisioUnit" and "VisioTBL" were omitted as they contained private code for commercial use, but they essentially act as the tools needed to get data from visio and into a pascal application.
